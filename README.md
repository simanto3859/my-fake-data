# my-fake-data
This is my fake data repo.
Some ideas on how to use fake data in projects are:

- Design your own mock APIs with Mockaroo
- Test your app with realistic data using Faker JS
- Generate fake company logos and addresses with Logo Ipsum
- Create random user photos with This Person Does Not Exist
- Simulate data analysis with fake datasets from Kaggle
